## Description 
  
Build a Node.js command line application that takes in user input to create a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo.
  
## Installation 
  

To run this application, use the command line to navigate to the directory of the application, install all dependencies (npm i), then type the command node index.js. You will then be taken through a series of questions. Once all questions have been answered properly, a message will display to the command line telling you your logo has been generated. Find your new logo in the newly generated SVG file.

For unit testing instructions, navigate to the Test Instructions section.
  
## Usage 
  

<img src="Assets/shape-demo.gif"><br>

1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/khoiphan-9194/OOP-Logo-Maker.git

2. Open in VS Code. If you do not have VS code you must install it.

3. Using the terminal, install node.js v16. 

4. Once node.js v16 is installed, in the terminal, utilize the command npm init -y to initialize and create a package.json where project files will be stored.

5. Next, use the terminal to run the command npm i to install the dependencies associated with this application (developers may need to install inquirer and jest directly from the command line, to do so the command for inquirer will be npm i inquirer@8.2.4 to install v8.2.4 of the inquirer, and npm i jest to install the latest version of jest).

6. To run the application, within the terminal, type the command node index.js.

## Tests
Each shape class (Circle, Square, and Triangle) is tested for a render() method that returns a string for the corresponfing SVG file matching color and text requests. Type "npm test" in the command line and Jest will run all three tests.
